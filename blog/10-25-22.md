# Encryption  

### What is encryption? 

#### Encryption is a process that scrambles readable text so it can only be read by the person who has the secret code,  or decryption key. It helps provide data security for sensitive information. 
### Why we need encryption??
<h4>
  Encryption is important for daily life because it helps to protect sensitive information, such as personal data and financial information, from unauthorized access. It allows individuals and organizations to secure their communications and stored data, ensuring that only those with the proper decryption key can access the information. This is especially important in the digital age, where much of our personal and professional lives are conducted online. Encryption also plays a critical role in protecting against cyber attacks and safeguarding against identity theft.
